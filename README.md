 ## Description
 
 The purpose of this project was to create a customizable task list.
 I made this project to display my compentency in building GET and POST routes in Express.js.
 This project overall solves the problem of remembering tasks I need to accomplish.
 I learned that it isn't easy to have a full front end application and not have a full back end application to connect the paths to.
 I followed the recommended best practice folder structure for this project.
   
 In the future I would like to have the delete button working.

## Installation
It is deployed, so you just have to put the URL in the address bar of your browser. https://note-taker-production-c813.up.railway.app/
## Usage
This is a screenshot of the start page on Railway.

This is a screenshot of the note page that you go to after you push the Get Started button on the start page. I have added a few asdf notes to show that it was working and would take in text and post it.

## Credits
I worked on this project myself, I watched the class videos twice all the way through and asked BCS questions about getting my local host to listen, about paths and folder structure.
